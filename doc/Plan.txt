Okay, here's the plan:

We got the tech demo being a mess of a code pile. It works, but I'm running myself into a wall.

Enter: EXC10 Take 2!

EXC10 Take 2 is for the creation of a reliable and coherent code STRUCTURE. As in: this is the Foundation only.
this means NO CODING THE ACTUAL THING! This is a skeleton. We are making blank variables, abstract classed, interfaces, and all that.

While we test proof of concepts in the Tech Demo, we will create a Foundation for easy code-integration later.
I assume both will influence the other, but that's fine.

NOW LET'S SOLVE THIS THING!
